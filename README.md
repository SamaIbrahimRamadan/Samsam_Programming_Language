###This is a simple programming language grammar with non-case-sensitive syntax. It has several terminals including ID, Integer, and Float. The grammar defines a program starting with the "Start" keyword and ending with the "End" keyword. The program contains a set of statements enclosed in curly braces.

###Statements include assignments, declarations, loops (for and while), switch statements, and conditional statements (if and if-else). The grammar supports arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

###The language also supports increment and decrement operations, as well as compound assignment operations. The grammar defines the structure of expressions for various comparisons, such as less than, greater than, equal to, and not equal to.

###Overall, this grammar defines the basic structure and operations of a programming language.
