## This grammar defines a programming language syntax that includes the following components:
#### - Terminals: identifiers, integers, and floating-point numbers.
#### - Non-terminals: program, constant, assignment, declaration, for loop, while loop, switch statement, if-else statement, expressions, statement list, and arithmetic operations.
#### - The program starts with the keyword "Start" and ends with "End" surrounded by braces.
#### - The constant non-terminal can have an assignment or declaration followed by a statement list, a for loop, a while loop, a switch statement, or an if-else statement.
#### - The assignment non-terminal assigns a value to an identifier.
#### - The declaration non-terminal initializes an identifier with an integer or a floating-point number.
#### - The for loop has three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
#### - The while loop executes a statement list while a condition is true.
#### - The switch statement executes a statement list based on the value of an identifier.
#### - The if-else statement executes a statement list if a condition is true and executes an alternative statement list if it's false.
#### - The expression non-terminal compares an identifier with an integer, true or false, or uses logical negation.
#### - The statement list can have a constant, an arithmetic operation, or be empty.
#### - The arithmetic operations can be addition, subtraction, division, or multiplication, with the possibility of an identifier being assigned a value based on the operation.
